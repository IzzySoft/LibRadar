# LibRadar
LibRadar is an automatic tool for Android library detection.

Upload your apk file and LibRadar can detect third-party libraries in Android apps accurately and instantly.

## Features

#### Fast
LibRadar takes just several seconds to scan an app and report the list of third-party libraries used in it.
#### Accurate
LibRadar is trained with more than 1 million apps from Google Play, so it can identify virtually all popular libraries in any given Android app.
#### Anti-Obfuscation
Many Android apps are obfuscated with tools such as ProGuard, which makes it difficult to recognize a library by its package names or class names.
LibRadar is obfuscation-resilient since we use features that cannot be obfuscated, such as statistics on Android APIs.

##Usage

Use __detect.py__ under the  main directory.

Input the first parameters as the path of the target apk.

```bash
$ python main/main.py ~/apks/sample.apk
```
Or modify the code in the main function.
